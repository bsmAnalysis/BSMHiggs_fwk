## Run GOF
1. make sure first you have the limit cards directory by running for example: python optimize_haa.py -p 4.0
2. Generate observed test statistics and expected distribution:
   Configure your cards directory in the script goodnessfit.sh, and make sure comment out the Zh or Wh part of code
> sh ./goodnessfit.sh
3. once finished, do the plot:
   Configure the input variable directory in the script plotGOF.py
> python plotGOF.py
   GOF.pdf will be produced under the current folder.

Note: if running Zh part, GOF plot will be produced for ee and mumu channel separately,
so you have to run ee and mumu part separately one by one in step 2.
